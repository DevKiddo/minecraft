# Minecraft Edison

Small Minecraft Server running on Intel Edison's Yocto Project.

Feel free to clone the repo to make your own server. Java, Htop, and Screen have all been 
pre-compiled so just run `make install` in their respective directories. Don't forget to run 
`iptables-restore < iptables.rules` to apply the necessary security rules, and move cacerts to 
java's certificates/security directory (run `find -name "cacerts"` to get the actual path). 
Finally, run `run.sh` in the minecraft folder to start the server.

You may also want to delete world in the minecraft folder since I'll be using this 
repo as a backup for my minecraft world.
